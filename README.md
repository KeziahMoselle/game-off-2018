## Goal "Hybrid"
The goal was to create a game which combined two types of game : shooter and rhythm game.
Unfortunately I started one week  before the end of the event and the goal is quite ambitious for a first game.

The idea was to press the `spacebar` accordingly with the music in the background and it will shoot the nearest ennemy with a bullet. If the timing is correct then the enemy dies however if the timing is wrong you die.
